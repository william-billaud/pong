2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell clock/clk_int[2]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) clock/clk_int_reg[0]/CLR, clock/clk_int_reg[1]/CLR, clock/clk_int_reg[2]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
